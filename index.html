					<h1>Personal Profile</h1>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>From an early age, I was always fascinated by how things worked. How my toys functioned, what made them move. This fascination only evolved when I was first introduced to computers in 2005 when my dad bought a Windows XP laptop. I was dazzled by what some of the programs could do, and I was always curious how they managed to do this. This is why, for my GCSE and A-Level, I chose to take computer science. My studies thus far have given me a diverse range of skills, including problem solving and logical thinking, and I also have a new understanding of data security and the internet’s structure as a whole. I pride myself on my communication and my ability to clearly convey my point across, as well as being able to help and support others, a valuable skill I learnt in my time as a teaching assistant. I always aim to go above and beyond, and truly believe that if a job is worth doing, it is worth doing right.</p>

					<p class="subDetails">June 2019 - Febuary 2020</p>
					<p>My role during my time there was to assist the student and staff with their IT skills. At the end of my work experience, I was pleased to receive a commendation from the school stating that I "carried out my duties diligently, with respect and discretion" and that I “communicate effectively”.</p>
